# DEVELOPING A FLOOD - HEALTH VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR THE CITY OF MILWAUKEE, WI

Combining data on health, housing, and socioeconomic vulnerability with flood exposure data to develop indicators and insights about the distribution of flood impacts in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

This project's original aim was to develop a flood-health vulnerability index (FHVI), a single metric useful to identify areas whose disproportionate exposure and vulnerability to flooding made them a priority when consider the allocation of funds and interventions for flood risk mitigation. However, the development process revealed the importance of being able to trace the different indicator categories considered. For example, it might be unclear why a given census tract stands out as a highly vulnerable one e.g. due to a combination of high vulnerability & exposure values, or just high vulnerability, but no exposure. Because of this, the project has transitioned into a Flood Health Vulnerability *Assessment*, in which several thematic indices are calculated and then overlaid without creating a new metric.

## Workflow

The project's current workflow consists of the following steps:



## Instructions to run the .src codebase



## Population data and variables considered in the Social Vulnerability Index



## Key assumptions to keep track of and consider revising in future iterations



## Fieldname definitions for output dataset
